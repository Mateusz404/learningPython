# Learning Python

A collection of my own solutions to the exercises in the
[**Python Programming Projects**](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-programming-projects/) Udemy course.
All code was written **from scratch, without looking at the course solutions**. The goal of this repository
is to track my progress and provide a reference for others who prefer to learn by doing.

Each numbered folder corresponds to a section of the course. Inside every folder you’ll find one or more
Python scripts (`ex1.py`, `ex2.py`, …) plus any data files needed by those scripts.

* **Self‑assessment** – Comparing my solutions with the instructor’s *afterward* helps
  identify alternate approaches.
